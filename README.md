## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of seismic sensing signals using machine learning techniques. It aims to accurately classify seismic events, such as aftershocks, and is based on a dataset from Northern Thessaly. The project employs Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and other algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
